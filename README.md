# My Personal Project: Bucket List

## Task 2

My application will be a system that stores a person's bucket list. Users will be able
to enter activities and goals that they want to accomplish. The system will keep track 
of the activities/goals that the user enters in chronological order. Users will be able to
mark tasks as complete and favourite tasks that they are keen on doing. This application 
is for anyone who wants to keep track of accomplishments and activities that they want to complete.
I often have a list of ideas and activities that I want to do, however I never write them down and
often forget. For instance, there are many places that I want to travel to and food places to try. 
Thus, this project is interesting to me because I think it will allow for myself and others to 
keep track of fun activities for the future!
