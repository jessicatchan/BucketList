# My Personal Project

## Task 2

My application will be a system that records monthly spending habits. Users 
will be able to enter the amount of money spent for each expense category. 
Possible expense categories could include housing, food, transportation, 
utilities, personal, and savings. The system will provide statistics with 
the proportion of money spent on each category. Additionally, it will include 
a bar chart visualizing the proportion of income spent on each category to make
it easy for users to visualize where most of their income goes respective to 
the given categories. Anyone who is making some sort of income may use this 
application. Specifically, this application may be most useful to young adults
who may be newly beginning to budget and manage their money. This project is 
interesting to me because as a young adult, I think it is important to start 
learning how to budget in preparing for the future.
